# AICTE - _VOIS for Tech Project - Diabetic Prediction
## Problem Statement:
i) Need for an accurate ML model to classify patients based on diabetes risk. <br>
ii) Global rise of diabetes demands early detection for effective management.

## Project Description:
i) Develop a robust ML model for patient classification. <br>
ii) Classify patients into high and low risk groups for diabetes. <br>
iii) Aid healthcare professionals in targeted interventions and preventive measures.

## Technology Used:
i) Artificial Intelligence <br>
ii) Machine Learning <br>
iii) Python <br>
iv) Libraries Used - Pandas, Numpy, Scikit, and Matplotlib

## Modelling:
The Support Vector Machines (SVMs) has been used for the diabetics prediction project as it is a solid choice. SVMs are effective for classification tasks, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data and binary classification problems like determining diabetes risk. The aim of an SVM is indeed to create an optimal hyperplane that separates classes, helping categorize new data points accurately.
<p>
SVM could be beneficial for the project for following reasons:<br>
1) Handling High-Dimensional Data <br>
2) Effective Separation of Classes <br>
3) Flexibility with Kernels <br>
4) Robustness to Outliers <br>
5) Generalization
